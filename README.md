### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm James Allison

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an embedded wildlife telemetry system with the San Diego Wildlife Alliance â€” building a solar-powered LoRa device to classify elephant movement using IMU data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced FPGA development with VHDL, SoC integration techniques, and low-power optimization strategies for embedded systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-time embedded projects, FPGA/SoC applications, or open-source hardware platforms â€” especially those with a conservation or social impact focus.
